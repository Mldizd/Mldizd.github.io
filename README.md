<p>This repository contains the publications on the topic of synchro-waveforms, created my <a href="Bio">Milad Izadi</a>.</p> 
  
<p> Synchro-waveforms are a powerful new technology for monitoring and situational awareness of power systems. They are obtained from a new class of smart grid sensors called Waveform Measurement Units (WMUs). WMUs provide precise time-synchronized voltage waveform and current waveform measurements in the time domain. This allows for detailed analysis of the waveshape of the voltage and current at very high resolutions.</p>

<p>WMUs operate at very high reporting rates, such as at 256 samples per cycle, i.e., 15,360 recordings per second. This is much higher than the sampling rate of practically every other smart grid sensor, such as phasor measurement units (PMUs). This results in a large amount of data that requires high-performance computing to analyze.</p>

<p>Synchro-waveforms offer groundbreaking applications in a variety of power system monitoring and situational awareness tasks, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Event detection and classification</li>
  <li>Event location identification</li>
  <li>Topology identification</li>
  <li>Network parameter estimation</li>
  <li>Asset monitoring</li>
  <li>Incipient fault detection</li>
  <li>Inverter-based energy resources monitoring</li>
  <li>Wildfire monitoring</li>
</ul>

<p>This repository contains a variety of resources related to synchro-waveforms, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Papers</li>
  <li>Presentations</li>
  <li>Talks</li>
</ul>

<p>This repository is intended to serve as a resource for researchers and practitioners who are interested in learning more about synchro-waveforms and their applications.</p>
