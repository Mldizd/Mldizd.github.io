<h2>Synchro-Waveforms Repository</h2>

<p>This repository contains the publications on the topic of synchro-waveforms, created my <a href="bio.html#bio">Dr. Milad Izadi</a>. It is freely accessible to the public and contains a wide range of research outputs, including US patents, journal articles, book chapters, dissertations, white papers, conference papers, and other original scholarly works.</p> 

<h2>What is Synchro-Waveforms?</h2>
	<p> Synchro-waveforms (also knowns as time-synchronized waveform measurements or 
	synchronized point-on-wave) are a powerful new technology for monitoring and situational awareness 
	of power systems. They are obtained from a new class of smart grid sensors called <i style="color: blue;">
	Waveform Measurement Units (WMUs)</i>. WMUs provide precise time-synchronized voltage waveform and current
	waveform measurements in the time domain. This allows for detailed analysis of the waveshape of the voltage
	and current at very high resolutions.</p>
	
	<p>WMUs operate at very high reporting rates, such as at 256 samples per cycle, i.e., 15,360 recordings
	per second. This is much higher than the reporting rate of practically every other smart grid sensors. At
	such high reporting rate, a WMU reports 7,962,624,000 data points per day from voltage and
	current waveforms on three phases. This is an overwhelming amount of data that requires high performance
	computing to analyze. Further, WMUs use a Global Positioning System (GPS) clock
	to precisely synchronize the sampling of waveforms across different WMUs, enabling precise time
	synchronization of the reported waveforms. The very high reporting rate of WMUs and the fact that 
	we have access to synchro-waveform measurements, can significantly enhance our understanding
	and awareness about the status of the power electric grid and its components.</p>
