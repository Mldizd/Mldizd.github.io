	 <p style="font-size: 11px;">The video above shows a synchronized Lissajous curve for a high impedance fault on a distribution feeder that is seen by two WMUs: (a)-(b) voltage and
	current waveform measurements from WMU 1 that is installed at the beginning of the feeder; (c)-(d) voltage and current waveform measurements from
	WMU 2 that is installed at the end of the feeder; (e) the corresponding synchronized Lissajous curve. Each time step in the video is 56 microseconds in real time.</p>

<h2>Synchro-Waveforms Repository</h2>

<p>This repository contains the publications on the topic of synchro-waveforms, created my <a href="#bio">Dr. Milad Izadi</a>. It is freely accessible to the public and contains a wide range of research outputs, including US patents, journal articles, book chapters, dissertations, white papers, conference papers, and other original scholarly works.</p> 

<h2>What is Synchro-Waveforms?</h2>
	<p> Synchro-waveforms (also knowns as time-synchronized waveform measurements or 
	synchronized point-on-wave) are a powerful new technology for monitoring and situational awareness 
	of power systems. They are obtained from a new class of smart grid sensors called <i style="color: blue;">
	Waveform Measurement Units (WMUs)</i>. WMUs provide precise time-synchronized voltage waveform and current
	waveform measurements in the time domain. This allows for detailed analysis of the waveshape of the voltage
	and current at very high resolutions.</p>
	
	<p>WMUs operate at very high reporting rates, such as at 256 samples per cycle, i.e., 15,360 recordings
	per second. This is much higher than the reporting rate of practically every other smart grid sensors. At
	such high reporting rate, a WMU reports 7,962,624,000 data points per day from voltage and
	current waveforms on three phases. This is an overwhelming amount of data that requires high performance
	computing to analyze. Further, WMUs use a Global Positioning System (GPS) clock
	to precisely synchronize the sampling of waveforms across different WMUs, enabling precise time
	synchronization of the reported waveforms. The very high reporting rate of WMUs and the fact that 
	we have access to synchro-waveform measurements, can significantly enhance our understanding
	and awareness about the status of the power electric grid and its components.</p>

<h2>Bio</h2>
<div id="bio"> <!-- Removed the "#" from the id -->
<p>My name is Milad Izadi, and I have started the new topic of <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9248804" target="_blank"><i>Synchro-Waveforms</i></a> in 2019. Since then, I have made <i>pioneering</i>  contributions towards using synchro-waveform measurements in power systems applications. I have eight (8) publications (all first-authored) in this specific topic, including 1 patent, 3 journal
papers, 1 book chapter, and 3 conference papers, along with a number of presentations and invited talks. I have now created this repository as a public resource for researchers and practitioners in academia and industry who are interested in learning more about synchro-waveforms and their applications. I have also created a website dedicated to synchro-waveforms, available at www.synchrowaveforms.com. I also earned my Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering-Power Systems in 2022. I am interested in the intersection of data analysis, machine learning, optimization, and simulation in power systems applications. I have also managed and performed interconnection technical studies such as power flow, transient stability, and short circuit studies for 
load and generation connections into the <a href="https://www.pjm.com/">PJM</a>, <a href="https://www.ercot.com/">ERCOT</a>, 
<a href="https://www.wecc.org/">WECC</a> power grids. I have collaborated with independent system operators, utilities, national labs, 
and industrial companies such as <a href="https://www.pjm.com/">PJM</a>, <a href="https://www.ercot.com/">ERCOT</a>, 
<a href="https://www.ladwp.com/">LADWP</a>, <a href="https://www.pge.com/">PG&E</a>, <a href="https://www.lbl.gov/">LBNL</a>,

on several cutting-edge projects.
